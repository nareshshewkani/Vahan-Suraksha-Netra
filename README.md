   The "**Vehicle Safety System**" represents a pivotal endeavor aimed at redefining road safety and enhancing the driver's experience through the integration of cutting-edge technology. This comprehensive project is built upon four essential modules, each designed to address critical aspects of road safety and driver well-being. These modules encompass **emotion detection and drowsiness monitoring** to ensure driver alertness, real-time traffic data analysis for **dynamic signal timing adjustments**, **speed detection** using highway cameras for enforcing safe driving limits, and **lane detection **coupled with collision warnings to prevent accidents. Together, these modules harness the power of machine learning and computer vision to process complex data in real-time, creating a seamless, safer, and more efficient driving experience.
